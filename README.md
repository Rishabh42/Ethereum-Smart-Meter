# Ethereum-Smart-Meter
Securing smart meters/ energy meters using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
This project provides a cost-effective way of linking a standard digital energy meter with blockchain.For demonstration purpose
we have tried to extract energy pulses from the meter into an Rpi and then simultaneously deploy it on blockchain. 
we still have some issues in 
running the chain with web3.py.Would appreciate contributions from people all around the globe.So come, fork into this potentially groundbreaking project
